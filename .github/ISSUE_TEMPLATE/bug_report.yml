        Please check all of the following options to prove that you have read and understood the requirements, otherwise this issue will be closed.
      options:
        - label: I confirm that I have read the documentation, understand the meaning of all the configuration items I wrote, and did not pile up seemingly useful options or default values.
          required: true
        - label: I provided the complete config and logs, rather than just providing the truncated parts based on my own judgment.
          required: true
        - label: I searched issues and did not find any similar issues.
          required: true
        - label: The problem can be successfully reproduced in the latest Release

        ## Configuration and Log Section
        
        ### For config
        Please provide the configuration files that can reproduce the problem, including the server and client.
        Don't just paste a big exported config file here. Eliminate useless options, this can help determine the problem, if you really want to get help.

        ### For logs
        Please set the log level to debug first.
        Restart XMPlus, then operate according to the reproduction method.
        Remember to delete parts with personal information (such as UUID and IP and host address).
        Provide the log of XMPlus backend logs, not the log output by the panel or other things.

        ### Finally
        After removing parts that do not affect reproduction, provide the actual running **complete** file, do not only provide inbound or outbound or a few lines of logs based on your own judgment.
        Put the content between the preset ```<details><pre><code>``` ```</code></pre></details>``` in the text box.
        If the problem is very clear that only related to one end (such as core startup failure/crash after correctly writing the config according to the documents), N/A can be filled in for unnecessary areas below.
